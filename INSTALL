KeepNote INSTALL Instructions
=============================


Windows Install

  There is a Binary Installer for Windows available on the KeepNote website.
  It is the recommended way to install KeepNote for Windows.


Linux Install

  Debian (or compatible distribution like Ubuntu)
    If you run the Debian distribution, I have created a *.deb package for
    keepnote available from the KeepNote website.  Before installing 
    keepnote ensure you have installed any required libraries with this
    command:

      $ apt-get install python python-gtk2 python-glade2 libgtk2.0-dev

    You most likely need root permissions for this command.
    There are also optional libraries (for enabling spell checking, etc)

      $ apt-get install python-gnome2-extras

    Once you download the package keepnote_X.Y.Z-1_all.deb you can install it 
    with the command

      $ dpkg -i keepnote_X.Y.Z-1_all.deb
      
  Other Linux distributions:

    You need to install these libraries (these are the names they have in 
    Debian but they should have similar names in other distributions).

      required: python python-gtk2 python-glade2 libgtk2.0-dev
      optional: python-gnome2-extras

    Once third-party libraries are installed, you can download and
    extract the .tar.gz file using the command (if you haven't already
    done so):

      $ tar zxvf keepnote-X.Y.Z.tar.gz

    Where X.Y.Z is the version of KeepNote you have downloaded.  One of
    the easiest ways to run keepnote, is directly from its source
    directory using the command

      $ YOUR_DOWNLOAD_PATH/keepnote-X.Y.Z/bin/keepnote

    or you can install with python distutils

      $ python setup.py install

    To install KeepNote as user you can do 

      $ python setup.py install --prefix=YOUR_INSTALL_LOCATION

    Lastly, KeepNote can be installed using Python's easy_install system

      $ easy_install keepnote

    This will download and install KeepNote to your default path.


Mac OS X Install

  All third-party libraries for the Linux version of KeepNote are 
  cross-platform and should also work for Mac OS X.  

     - python (http://www.python.org)
     - gtk (http://www.gtk.org)
     - pygtk (http://www.pygtk.org)

  All of these libraries are also available through Mac Ports on Mac OS X.  Once
  installed, KeepNote can be run directly from its source directory

    $ path-to-keepnote-src/bin/keepnote
  
  To install dependencies with MacPorts use the following command:

    $ sudo port install py25-gtk aspell aspell-dict-en sqlite3

  You may need to add your own language's dictionary (aspell-dict-XX) for 
  spell checking to work completely.

  Alternative: Another option for running KeepNote is to use the Windows 
  version in WINE or a Virtual Machine (VMware, etc).


=============================================================================
Windows Build

  Most people will just want to install KeepNote.  For basic installation, 
  see the Windows Install instructions above.  These instructions are for 
  developers who want to *build* the windows installer.
  
  First install these third party packages.  Versions that are known
  to work are given below, but higher version are likely to also work.
  
    python-2.5.1.msi
    gtk-dev-2.12.9-win32-2.exe
    pygtk-2.12.1-1.win32-py2.5.exe
    pyobject-2.14.1-1.win32-py2.5.exe
    pycario-1.4.12-1.win32-py2.5.exe
    py2exe-0.6.6.win32-py2.5.exe
    isetup-5.2.3.exe  (Inno Setup)
    pywin32-210.win32-py2.5.exe

  NOTE: pygtk-2.12.1-2.win32-py2.5.exe (notice the -2) seems to have a bug
  with get_source_widget()

  Once third-party packages are installed, execute in the KeepNote source dir:
  
    $ python setup.exe py2exe

  - Use Inno to compile installer.iss
  
  Installer will be in Output/keepnote-X.Y.Z.exe
